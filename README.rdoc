== README

This application will mimic something a temp agency could use, with a database of employees and their specified skills, and a database of current jobs, with a list of appropriate skills needed for the job. The
app could then be used to place employees to temp jobs, but only if their skills matched those needed for the job.

Some "skill" examples that could be used
* Carpentry
* Construction
* Customer Service
* Retail
* Service Industry
* Python
* Networking
